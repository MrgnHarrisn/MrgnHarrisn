- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrgnHarrisn
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Volleyball, Hockey and learning languages!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to play Volleyball and program in Java (through University) and learning a little C on the side!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything as I am learning and am happy to gain experience programming with other (probably with more experience)
- 📫 I am relatively new to the programming scene aside from the python basics when I was younger
